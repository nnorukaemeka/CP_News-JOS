# CP_News-JOS
Code-Plateau News (CP News) is a Code Plateau BackEnd Project Developed Using Python Flask Framework
With this project, I was able to learn how to:
  * create a database using Mysql workbench, 
  * reference foreign keys (relationship between taables)
  * write CRUD SQL queries,
  * create Login, Register and Dashboard, Articles and Comments pages
  * authenticate, validate and verify an account
  * Model - View - Controller (MVC)
  * Use FLASK framework and jinja 2 template in creating projects
